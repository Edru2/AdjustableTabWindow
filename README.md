# AdjustableTabWindow
Tabbed Windows made of Adjustable Containers for Mudlet.

Adds the posibility to have a TabWindow with tabs where the positon of them is changeable by MouseClick.
They are also interchangable by dragging to another TabWindow.

If the other TabWindow is in a UserWindow it's possible by doubleclick to transfer your tab there.

Dragging to an open space on the screen will create a Window with the tab Content (This window is a standard Adjustable.Container)

Tab positions can be saved an reloaded.
